# Content Formatting and Translation Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Content Formatting Issues**
**Problem**: Many articles had English content formatted with HTML but Khmer content was not formatted (only 13% of articles had Khmer HTML formatting).

**Root Cause**: 
- The content formatter was not being applied consistently to both languages
- The backend formatting route was incorrectly setting both English and Khmer content to the same value when receiving a single string
- Some articles had plain text content that needed HTML formatting

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the backend content formatting route in `backend/routes/news.mjs`
- Created a comprehensive fix script that processes all articles
- Applied basic HTML formatting to both English and Khmer content consistently

### 2. **Translation Issues**
**Problem**: Some articles had the same English title/description for both languages instead of proper Khmer translations.

**Root Cause**:
- Translation was not being applied consistently during article creation/update
- Some articles were created before the translation system was fully implemented

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the translation system to handle both content and metadata
- Created scripts to identify and fix missing translations
- Improved error handling for translation failures

### 3. **Inconsistent Content Processing**
**Problem**: Content formatting was not being applied at the right time in the workflow.

**Root Cause**:
- Content formatting was sometimes applied during manual article creation instead of during Sentinel processing
- The auto-publish service wasn't consistently formatting content before publishing

**Solution**:
- Fixed the content formatting flow to apply at the correct times:
  - During Sentinel processing (when content is ingested)
  - When articles are moved to published status
  - During auto-publish process
- Improved the auto-publish service to format content before publishing
